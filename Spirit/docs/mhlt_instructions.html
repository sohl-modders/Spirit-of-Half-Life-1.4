 <p>The <code>NULL</code> texture is one that is removed from the map during compilation, so that it
    won't exist when you play the compiled .bsp file in Half-Life. You should be able to apply it to
    any entity or world brush within your map.</p>
    
 <p>The main point of this texture is to use it on faces that the player would under normal 
    circumstances <b>never</b> see, so that those faces will not add to the w_poly count and lower 
    the fps (frames per second) rate. You can also use the <code>SKY</code> texture for this exact 
    same purpose, although there have been recent debates about whether this is actually beneficial.
    While it does lower the w_poly count, it apparently also lowers the fps rate, thereby defeating 
    its original purpose.
    </p>

 <p><font color="#EEEEEE">If you wish to use the <code>NULL</code> texture, make sure that you 
    extract <code>zhlt.wad</code> from this zip to some directory, and add it to your texture wad 
    configuration in Worldcraft (goto Tools, Options... and click on the Textures tab, then click on
    Add).</font>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px 0px; border-color: #B36804">
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&nbsp;<a name="2"></a></td>
    <td><font class="sechead">automatic wad detection</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

 <p>Automatic wad detection is a simple utility that will exclude any wadfiles from the bsp that 
    aren't in use by the map.
    </p>

 <p>This gives you, the mapper, the potential to add any assortment of wadfiles you wish, and yet 
    only have those that are actually used by the map included in the .bsp file.
    </p>

 <p><font color="#EEEEEE">If you wish to enable this feature, simply use the 
    <code>-wadautodetect</code> flag in the hlcsg commandline.</font>
    </p>

    <td width="15">&nbsp;<a name="3"></a></td>
    <td><font class="sechead">clipnode economy mode</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

 <p><font color="#EEEEEE">This 'mode' is on by default in hlcsg, and does not require any 
    interaction from the user at all. You can remain blissfully ignorant of this feature if you so 
    wish. </font>
    </p>
 
 <p>Clipnodes are 'planes' that restrict the player movement. They are placed along the walls and 
    floors of your level, so that they player cannot pass though them. However, like everything else
    in the Half-Life universe, they are limited, and will max out with compile errors if you end up 
    using too many of them.
    </p>

 <p>In this build of the tools, hlcsg will analyse how the clipnodes are being used in your map. If 
    it thinks that it can get away with <b>not</b> using clipnodes in any particular situation 
    (such as in func_illusionaries which don't need clipnodes), then hlcsg will strip them away from
    the level. This means that by default, your clipnode counts will be lower than normal. 
    However, <b>it doesn't</b> automatically mean that you will never see another MAX_MAP_CLIPNODES 
    error in your life, it just means it's less likely to happen in the first place.
    </p>

 <p><font color="#EEEEEE">If you believe that this feature is causing you troubles, than you have 
    the option of turning it off. To do so, simply add the <code>-noclipeconomy</code> flag to the
    hlcsg commandline.</font>

    <font color="#EEEEEE">Really horrible HLRAD hack by Adam Foster</font><br>
    <br>
    It's a hack to HLRAD that allows a different colour for the diffuse light
    from a light_environment, more accurately mimicking real-world lighting
    (yellow sun, blue sky).<br>
    <br>
    It uses a new key, '_diffuse_light', in the light_environment - this gives
    the colour and intensity of the diffuse lighting, ie light from the sky,
    not from the sun.<br>
    <br>
    It should be fully backwards-compatible with older maps - if there's no
    '_diffuse_light' key, it uses the intensity from the standard '_light'
    key.<br>
    <br>
    Hope somebody finds it useful...<br>

 <p><b>Release Information</b></font><br>
    <font color="#EEEEEE">The texture wad configuration file, called <b>wad.cfg</b> should be 
    extracted to the same directory as the compile tools, or your Half-Life 
    directory.</font>
    </p>

 <p><b>Whats the purpose of this feature?</b><br>
    Say, you map for 3 mods: Counter-Strike, TFC, and normal Half-Life Single Player. All three of 
    these mods use different wads. Say you wanted to work on your Counter-Strike map one day, and 
    TFC the next: because Worldcraft does not store which wad files are in use for each game 
    configuration, you would need to go into Worldcraft texture configuration, Add/Remove wad files 
    from the list, and Restart Worldcraft.
    </p>

 <p>The idealistic solution to this would be to make it so that Worldcraft stores which wad files 
    are in use for any given game configuration, but that's not as easy as it would first appear. 
    autolycus of the Valve-ERC states  that "<i>This is one of the most requested things, so yes, we
    know about it. I've requested the feature several times. You can be assured, Mr. Speyrer knows 
    that this would be a handy thing.</i>".
    </p>

 <p><b>The solution</b><bR>
    So, for the mean time, I have devised up this method to overcome the hassle of restarting 
    Worldcraft. In the <code>wad.cfg</code> file, you can explicitly define what wads you want 
    written into the .bsp file, regardless of what happens to be in Worldcraft, for any given game 
    configuration. So, now, hlcsg will ignore the wads that you have configured in Worldcraft, and 
    instead only write in the ones you specify.
    </p>

 <p>The specific syntax for the file is the following:</p>

    <blockquote><font face="courier new">
        <font color="#3399CC">configuration_name</font><br>
        {<br>
        <font color="#FF6633">c:\path\to\wad\wad1.wad</font><br>
        <font color="#FF6633">c:\path\to\wad\wad2.wad</font><br>
        <font color="#FFCC66">include c:\path\to\wad\wad3.wad</font><br>
        }
    </font></blockquote>

 <p>Where:
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#3399CC" face="courier new">configuration_name</font> is some sort of 
            descriptive word. Examples: <i>valve</i>, <i>cs</i>, <i>tfc</i> etc...
        <li><font color="#FF6633" face="courier new">c:\path\to\wad\wad<i>n</i>.wad</font> is the 
            full path to a texture wad file. if you are unsure as to what this should be, take a 
            look at the paths in the Textures tab in Worldcraft configuration.
        <li>If a wad is prefixed by <font color="#FFCC66" face="courier new">include</font>, that 
            wad will be automatically wadincluded into the .bsp file.
        <li>There is no limit to the number of configurations, or the number of wads you can have 
            per configuration.
    </ul>
    All that remains now is for me to run hlcsg.exe with the parameter 
    <font color="#EEEEEE"><code>-wadconfig configuration_name</code></font>.
    </p>

 <p>Lets take an example. Say i wanted to create a configuration called 'my_wads'. It has 3 standard
    wadfiles in it: 'halflife.wad', 'liquids.wad' and 'xeno.wad', all of which can be found in the 
    valve directory, because they all came with Half-Life. It also has a custom wad created by me 
    called 'mywad.wad', which I want to compile into the .bsp file, which also happens to be in the 
    valve directory. My configuration might look something like this:
    </p>

    <blockquote><font face="courier new">
        <font color="#3399CC">my_wads</font><br>
        {<br>
        <font color="#FF6633">C:\Sierra\Half-Life\valve\halflife.wad</font><br>
        <font color="#FF6633">C:\Sierra\Half-Life\valve\liquids.wad</font><br>
        <font color="#FF6633">C:\Sierra\Half-Life\valve\xeno.wad</font><br>
        <font color="#FFCC66">include C:\Sierra\Half-Life\valve\mywad.wad</font><br>
        }
    </font></blockquote>

 <P>Now, when i run hlcsg.exe when i compile my map, i put 
    <font color="#EEEEEE"><code>-wadconfig my_wads</code></font> in the command line.
    </p>

 <p><font color="#EEEEEE">If you really don't understand the wad.cfg file syntax, then don't worry. 
    You don't have to use it.</font> However, it does come with some example configurations already 
    in it; just open it in notepad and see if you can get the hang of it, because it can be quite
    handy.

    This is a simple little point-based entity that you can place in your map, from which you can 
    select standard compile settings instead of using the command line switches.<br>
    <br>
    If you use the -verbose flag (or even set Verbose Compile Messages to On in the entity!), the 
    tool will print out its usage settings from the info_compile_parameters entity.<br>
    <br>
    If your .fgd file does not have this entity in it, you can add the following code to the end of 
    your .fgd (compatible with all versions of Worldcraft):<br>

    <td width="15">&nbsp;<a name="8"></a></td>
    <td><font class="sechead">info_texlights map entity</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

    The <font color="#EEEEEE">info_texlights</font> entity can act as a replacement for a lights.rad 
    file, in that it simply resides within the map as a point based entity. The usefulness of this 
    is that each map can have its own unique ambient lighting applied to it, and those settings will
    travel with the map and not affect any other maps.<br>   
    <br>
    Usage of the entity is much like that of the multimanager. To add an entry, take smart-edit off 
    in Worldcraft and add key value pairs in manually; the key should contain the name of the 
    texture to apply lighting to, and the value a set of numbers representing the red green blue 
    lumionsity(brightness) of the texture, just as you would in the lights.rad file.<br>
    <br>
    Notes: The presence of this file will not override the lights.rad, both the values specified in 
    this entity and the lights.rad file will be used by hlrad. Thanks goes out to Laurie Cheers from
    the <a href="http://spirit.valve-erc.com/">Spirit of Half-Life</a> mod for the idea behind this
    entity.<br>    
    <br>
    If your .fgd does not contain an info_texlights entity, then you can add this line of code to 
    your .fgd yourself:
<pre>@PointClass color(255 128 0) = info_texlights : "Texture Light Config" []</pre>


<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px 0px; border-color: #B36804">
  <tr>
    <td width="15">&nbsp;<a name="8"></a></td>
    <td><font class="sechead">Pulsing/Flickering texlights</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

    All texlights can now pulse and flicker, like normal light entities can. To use this feature,
    set the 'style' value on the brush entity with the light texture.
    <br>
    If your .fgd doesn't include style values, add the following code to 
    each entity that needs flickering texlights:
<pre>	style(choices) : "Texlight style" : 0 =
	[
		0 : "Normal"
		10: "Fluorescent flicker"
		2 : "Slow, strong pulse"
		11: "Slow pulse, noblack"
		5 : "Gentle pulse"
		1 : "Flicker A"
		6 : "Flicker B"
		3 : "Candle A"
		7 : "Candle B"
		8 : "Candle C"
		4 : "Fast strobe"
		9 : "Slow strobe"
		12: "Underwater"
	]</pre>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px 0px; border-color: #B36804">

    <td><font class="sechead">max vis distance</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

    <font color="#EEEEEE">Maximum Distance Visibility (MDV)</font> is a new feature that prevents 
    leafs beyond a certain distance from being rendered (or even sent to the renderer at all). In 
    conjunction with fog, it can become the ultimate catalyst when building and compiling large 
    maps, especially those with open areas. However, due to the nature of the calculations, not all 
    leaves beyond a certain distance are guaranteed to be prevented from being rendered; but those 
    that are within the maximum distance are gauranteed to be rendered.<br>
    <br>
    To use this feature, include the <font color="#EEEEEE"><code>-maxdistance #</code></font> 
    parameter with your hlvis command line, where <font color="#EEEEEE"><code>#</code></font> is the 
    maximum distance in units. <br>
    <br>
    There is a small side effect when using the Maximum Distance feature. hlrad relies heavily on 
    the visibility matrix to speed up lighting operations. As such, a normal rad of the map will 
    result in ackward, "cut off" lighting. This problem is easily solved, however it requires that 
    you use Adam Foster's special version of hlrad, which accomodates for the MDV lighting problem. 
    (ed. Note: The version of hlrad included in this release is the aforementioned hlrad.)
    When you use the <font color="#EEEEEE"><code>-maxdistance</code></font> parameter, an extra file
    named <code>&lt;mapname&gt;.vdt</code> that contains the real visibility matrix (i.e without any
    MDV performed) will be created. Adam's hlrad will use this file to correctly light the map. <br>
